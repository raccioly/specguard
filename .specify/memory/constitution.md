# DocGuard Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. LLM-First, CLI-Second

DocGuard is built for AI coding agents. Every feature MUST be designed for LLM consumption first, with CLI as a secondary interface. Skills (behavior protocols) take priority over CLI commands (step-lists). When DocGuard detects an AI agent environment, it MUST surface skill-based instructions. CLI output MUST be machine-parseable (JSON mode) alongside human-readable text.

### II. Zero NPM Runtime Dependencies (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

DocGuard has zero `node_modules` at runtime. All Node.js functionality uses built-in modules only (`node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:child_process`, `node:test`, `node:url`, `node:readline`, `node:os`, `node:assert`). This maximizes portability, eliminates supply chain risk, and ensures instant `npx` usage. Dev dependencies are also zero — tests use `node:test`. DocGuard depends on spec-kit as a **framework convention** (`.specify/` directory structure, skill architecture, constitution pattern). This is an integration, not a code dependency. When the `specify` CLI is available, DocGuard MUST leverage it for initialization and skill management.

### III. Documentation as Source of Truth

Canonical-Driven Development means documentation drives code, not the other way around. DocGuard enforces this by validating code against `docs-canonical/` and detecting drift. Any deviation from canonical docs MUST be logged in `DRIFT-LOG.md` with `// DRIFT: reason` inline comments. The `docguard guard` command is the enforcement gate.

### IV. Validator Isolation

Each of the 19 validators is a pure, self-contained function. Validators receive `projectDir` and `config`, then return results. No validator may import another validator or depend on command-level logic. Validators MAY (and SHOULD) import shared utility modules (`shared.mjs`, `shared-ignore.mjs`) for cross-cutting infrastructure such as file walking, ignore filtering, and glob matching. Commands MAY compose results from multiple validators. This ensures adding or modifying validators never breaks existing ones while preventing duplicated infrastructure that drifts out of sync.

### V. AI as Author, CLI as Orchestrator

The CLI detects problems and generates structured prompts. The AI agent writes the actual documentation. DocGuard MUST NOT generate final documentation content itself — it provides research instructions, templates, and validation. The `fix`, `diagnose`, and `generate` commands produce AI-actionable output, not finished documents.

### VI. Safe Writes

All file write operations MUST use defensive patterns. Before overwriting any file, DocGuard creates backups. The `--force` flag is required to overwrite existing files. Init and setup commands skip files that already exist unless explicitly forced.

### VII. Spec Kit Extension Compliance

DocGuard is a community extension of GitHub Spec Kit. It MUST follow spec-kit conventions: `extension.yml` schema, skill architecture (`SKILL.md` files with YAML frontmatter), workflow hooks (`after_implement`, `before_tasks`, `after_tasks`), and the `.specify/` directory structure. DocGuard MUST always install spec-kit core skills alongside its own skills so users get the complete spec-driven development workflow.

## Technology Constraints

- **Language**: JavaScript (ES Modules only, no CommonJS)
- **Runtime**: Node.js ≥ 18 (for native `node:test` and ES module support)
- **Dependencies**: None. Zero. Ever. This is a hard constraint.
- **Distribution**: npm (`docguard-cli`) + PyPI (`docguard`)
- **Testing**: `node:test` + `node:assert` (built-in, no framework)
- **Extension**: VS Code Extension API for editor integration
- **Config**: `.docguard.json` for project-level customization
- **Profiles**: starter, standard, enterprise compliance levels
- **Output**: Text (human) + JSON (machine) dual output for all commands

## Extension & Spec Kit Compliance

- DocGuard MUST declare all skills, scripts, hooks, and commands in `extension.yml`
- DocGuard MUST bundle spec-kit core skills so users don't need a separate install
- All 4 DocGuard skills (`docguard-guard`, `docguard-fix`, `docguard-review`, `docguard-score`) MUST follow spec-kit skill architecture: YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, `compatibility`, `metadata`
- Workflow hooks MUST be optional (never force execution)
- The `ensureSkills()` function MUST auto-detect and install both DocGuard skills AND spec-kit core skills
- DocGuard MUST detect agent environment (LLM vs CLI) and adapt its output accordingly

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all ad-hoc practices. Amendments require:
1. Documentation of the change in `DRIFT-LOG.md` if deviating
2. Update this constitution with a version bump
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with the change
4. All PRs MUST pass `docguard guard` before merge

Versioning follows semantic versioning:
- **MAJOR**: Principle removal or backward-incompatible redefinition
- **MINOR**: New principle added or materially expanded guidance
- **PATCH**: Clarification, wording, typo fix

**Version**: 1.1.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-03-17 | **Last Amended**: 2026-03-17
