# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is SpecGuard?

SpecGuard is an AI-native CLI tool that enforces Canonical-Driven Development (CDD). It ensures your project documentation stays accurate, comprehensive, and in sync with your code — using AI to write and maintain the docs.

### What is CDD?

Canonical-Driven Development is a methodology where documentation is the source of truth. Instead of writing code first and documenting later (which leads to "document rot"), CDD enforces that documentation exists, is structured, and stays fresh.

### Does SpecGuard write documentation for me?

**No — but it tells AI what to write.** SpecGuard generates structured research prompts that AI agents execute. The AI reads your codebase, writes the documentation, and SpecGuard verifies it's correct. Your role: review what the AI wrote.

### What's the difference between SpecGuard and just writing docs manually?

SpecGuard adds three things:
1. **Structure** — Enforces consistent doc templates across all projects
2. **Enforcement** — Validates docs exist, have required sections, stay fresh
3. **AI automation** — Generates prompts so AI writes the docs, not humans

## Commands

### What's the most important command?

**`specguard diagnose`** — it's the primary command. It runs all checks, identifies every issue, and generates AI fix prompts in a single output. Start here.

### What's the difference between `guard` and `diagnose`?

| Command | Purpose | When to use |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `guard` | Identify issues (pass/fail gate) | CI pipelines, pre-commit hooks |
| `diagnose` | Identify + generate fix prompts | Development, AI agents, fixing docs |

`diagnose` runs `guard` internally and adds the fix layer on top.

### What's the difference between `fix` and `diagnose`?

`fix` generates prompts for individual documents (`fix --doc architecture`). `diagnose` runs everything at once and outputs a combined remediation plan. Use `diagnose` for a full health check; use `fix --doc` when you know exactly which doc needs work.

### What does `generate` do that `init` doesn't?

`init` creates empty skeleton templates. `generate` scans your existing codebase and creates pre-filled docs with real content (detected components, routes, env vars, etc.).

## Profiles

### What profile should I use?

| Situation | Profile |
|-----------|---------|
| Side project, tutorial, prototype | `starter` |
| Team project, active development | `standard` (default) |
| Regulated, enterprise, compliance | `enterprise` |

### Can I switch profiles later?

Yes. Change the `"profile"` field in `.specguard.json` and run `specguard diagnose` to see what's missing.

### Can I override specific validators within a profile?

Yes. Profile sets the baseline, your config overrides:

```json
{
  "profile": "starter",
  "validators": {
    "freshness": true
  }
}
```

## Document Tax

### What is "document tax"?

The time and effort required to maintain documentation. Too little documentation leads to "document rot" (stale, useless docs). Too much enforcement creates "document tax" (developers spend more time on docs than code).

### How does SpecGuard avoid document tax?

1. **AI writes the docs** — human cost drops to near-zero
2. **Compliance profiles** — choose the right level for your project
3. **`score --tax`** — measures your actual maintenance cost
4. **Smart enforcement** — only flags when relevant code changed

### What does `score --tax` show?

```
📋 Documentation Tax Estimate
─────────────────────────────────
Tracked docs:        7 files
Active profile:      standard
Est. maintenance:    ~5 min/week
Tax-to-value ratio:  LOW
```

If tax is HIGH, consider using `starter` profile or letting AI handle more.

---

## CI/CD

### How do I add SpecGuard to CI?

```bash
npx specguard ci --format json --threshold 70
```

Exit code 0 = pass, 1 = fail. Use `--threshold` to set minimum score.

### Is there a GitHub Action?

Yes — SpecGuard ships a template at `templates/ci/github-actions.yml`. Copy it to `.github/workflows/` or use the reusable action in `action.yml`.

### Does SpecGuard block commits?

Only if you install hooks (`specguard hooks`). Without hooks, it's advisory only.

---

## Technical

### Does SpecGuard have dependencies?

**Zero.** Pure Node.js, no npm dependencies. Works with Node.js 18+.

### Does it work with non-JavaScript projects?

Yes. SpecGuard validates documentation structure, not code. It works with any project that has a `docs-canonical/` directory. Some validators (architecture import analysis) are JavaScript-focused, but the core CDD framework is language-agnostic.

### Does SpecGuard read my code?

Yes — for features like `generate`, `diff`, and `architecture` validation. It reads local files only. No data is sent anywhere.

### Can I disable validators I don't need?

Yes. In `.specguard.json`:

```json
{
  "validators": {
    "security": false,
    "freshness": false
  }
}
```

Or use a profile that has them disabled by default (like `starter`).
