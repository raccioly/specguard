# DocGuard Guard

Validate your project against its canonical documentation. Runs 51 automated checks across 10 validators with quality labels.

## User Input

$ARGUMENTS

## Steps

1. Run DocGuard guard validation on the current project:

```bash
npx --yes docguard-cli@latest guard $ARGUMENTS
```

2. Review the output. Each validator shows:
   - **[HIGH]** — 90%+ checks passed
   - **[MEDIUM]** — 50-89% checks passed
   - **[LOW]** — Below 50% checks passed

3. If there are failures, run `speckit.docguard.diagnose` for AI-ready fix prompts.

## Validators
