# Test Specification

<!-- docguard:version 0.7.0 -->
<!-- docguard:status active -->
<!-- docguard:last-reviewed 2026-03-13 -->

> DocGuard is a zero-dependency CLI tool. CLI integration tests cover the full stack.

| Metadata | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Status** | ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-active-brightgreen) |
| **Project Type** | CLI |
| **Test Framework** | `node:test` (built-in) |
| **Test Files** | `tests/` |

---

DocGuard's tests verify command behavior through subprocess execution. Each test runs the full CLI binary via execSync, capturing stdout and checking output patterns. This approach tests the complete stack in a single pass: argument parsing, config loading, validator execution, and output formatting.

Tests are designed to be config-aware. They verify that project-type settings like needsEnvExample and testFramework correctly influence scoring and validation behavior. Regression guards pin specific bug fixes with dedicated assertions, ensuring fixed issues cannot recur.

All tests use the built-in node:test framework with zero test dependencies. The test suite runs in under 10 seconds and is executed automatically by CI on every push.

Test names follow the pattern: "verb + expected behavior" (e.g., "runs and shows a score", "respects projectTypeConfig"). Each test is self-contained with no shared mutable state between tests.

## Test Categories

| Category | Framework | Location | Run Command |
|----------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Unit | node:test | tests/ | `npm test` |
| CLI Integration | node:test | tests/ | `npm test` |

> **CLI integration tests cover the full stack** — this is a CLI tool with zero UI surface.
> Commands are validated end-to-end via Node.js subprocess execution, making separate E2E tests redundant.

## Coverage Rules

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|:------:|:-------:|

| Validator Coverage | 80% | 100% (12/12 validators) |
| Flag Coverage | 80% | 100% |
| Test Count | — | 33 tests, 17 suites |

> **Note**: `watch.mjs` is an interactive file-watcher (uses `fs.watch` + process signals). It is
> verified via manual execution rather than automated tests, which is appropriate for
> interactive/daemon-style commands per ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-3 §7.2 (manual test procedures).
